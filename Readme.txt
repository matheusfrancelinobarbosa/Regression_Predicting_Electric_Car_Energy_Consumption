ML Project (Regression):
Predicting Electric Car Energy Consumption.

As our target variable is numerical, we will use regression models to predict the values.

In this project the R programming language and its libraries were used.
dplyr and plyr for data manipulation.
GGPLOT for graphical visualization.
For the ML models CARET and Random Forest package models were used.
ML models used: Linear Regression and NeuralNet
